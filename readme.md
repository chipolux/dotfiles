Just some dotfiles.

Most things should just work out-of-the-box as long as you have up to date
versions of vim, zsh, weechat, mutt, and tmux.

Just run the `install.sh` script to get things setup!

## URxvt and Colors
Colors in vim and tmux may not look right unless you have rxvt-unicode-256color
installed.

## Latest Versions
On Ubuntu the latest versions of tmux and weechat aren't always in the default
repos, but you can add `ppa:pi-rho/dev` for tmux and `ppa:nesthib/weechat-stable`
for weechat.
